This is the repository for active development work on [revenuedata.doi.gov](https://revenuedata.doi.gov). See [releases](https://github.com/ONRR/nrrd/releases) for information about the current version of the site.

**For more detailed process, development, and data information, please see our [repository's wiki](https://github.com/ONRR/nrrd/wiki).**

## What

The U.S. earns revenue on natural resources (such as oil, gas, coal and geothermals) extracted from federal lands and waters. This is a major source of revenue for both the federal government, state governments, and local municipalities.

This repository contains the code for revenuedata.doi.gov, which is a website that includes both curated content and raw data to better inform the national and international conversation around extractive industries revenue. It will provide data visualizations and information thatâ€™s  understandable to members of the public and can be re-used through other media and applications.

For more information about the history of the site, see [about this site](https://revenuedata.doi.gov/about/).
